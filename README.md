# GradientDescent_Optimizing_LinearRegression
# This code uses gradient descent (popular first-order optimazation function.) as a means of performing linear regression on a dataset # of test scores vs hours studied.  Attempts to model this data linearly using the popular y = mx + b, slope-intercept formula.
